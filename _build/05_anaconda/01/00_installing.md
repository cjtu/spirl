# Installing Anaconda

Anaconda is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Head to the following link and follow the prompts to the appropriate *Python 3* installer for your system:

**Note for Windows users**: If you use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (Bash on Windows), don't use the Windows install link for Anaconda. Instead, I recommend checking out the following tutorial: [link](https://gist.github.com/kauffmanes/5e74916617f9993bc3479f401dfec7da)

## Note on IDEs

Anaconda comes with a code editor called **Spyder** which can be helpful for working with data (and feels very similar to MATLAB, if you've used that before). Recently, Anaconda began offering [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an optional download. VS Code is a powerful code editor (often called an IDE, or Integrated Development Environment in programming-speak) which has quickly gained popularity in the software developer and scientific programming communities.

Most IDEs have some useful tools in common:

- auto-completion of functions as you type
- help hints on functions (so you don't need to type `help(function)` every time)
- *linters* which analyze the style of your code to help you make it more readable and get into good style habits
- fast search across many files and directories (ever needed to dig into 15 files to find where a variable is defined?)

If you plan to write code, it is a good idea to install and learn use an IDE. A guide to Python IDEs can be found [here](https://realpython.com/python-ides-code-editors-guide/), and a guide to getting started with Visual Studio Code, my current IDE of choice, can be found [here](https://realpython.com/python-development-visual-studio-code/).
