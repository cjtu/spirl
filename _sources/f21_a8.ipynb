    "## Installing from source\n",
    "\n",
    "Last time we saw how to install new Python packages form the internet with `conda` and `pip`, but sometimes we need to install packages directly from their source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, first check the official documentation for the package you want to use and try their recommended installation instructions!\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing from the source code is done for 3 primary reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code isn't yet available on the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org)).\n",
    "2. The code has complicated dependencies that cannot be easily installed by `pip` or `conda` alone.\n",
    "3. You are contributing to the source code of an open source project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into the details of installing from source, we'll take a detour through python **scripts**, **modules**, and **packages**."

    "## Python scripts, modules and packages\n",
    "\n",
    "We have spent most of the term using only Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`), but it's important to understand when to use `.py` files as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are convenient for quick data analysis / plotting code, but using pure `.py` files is an important part of any Python project. We want to use `.py` files because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They can keep our larger projects organized\n",
    "- We can re-use code in a `.py` file much easier than in a `.ipynb` notebook\n",
    "- We can run code in a `.py` directly from the terminal (useful for cloud / cluster computing)\n",
    "\n",
    "A `.py` file can be one of two main types which differ in their goals for organizing and running our code. These types are the **Python script** and **Python module**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python script is a file meant to be run from top to bottom to produce a certain effect or output. Scripts we typically want to run from the terminal with a `python` command like:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python run_program.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the code necessary to perform a task is contained within the script and the program stops after it has run all of its code. For example, say the following file is called `quadratic.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "\"\"\"Plot a quadratic function with errors.\"\"\"\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "def quadratic_errors(x, err=10):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Return quadratic in x with err.\"\"\"\n",
    "    y = (x + np.random.randint(0, 10, 100))**2\n",
    "    return y\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    x = np.arange(100)\n",
    "    y = quadratic_errors(x)\n",
    "    plt.plot(x, y)\n",
    "    plt.savefig('quadratic_with_errors.png')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We could run it from the terminal with:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python quadratic.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the script has a docstring at the top of the file describing what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, our code uses `savefig` to export an image of our plot since we won't have a nice notebook interface to preserve our figures. Make sure you save the data or plots you need when working with a script!\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block indicates the parts of the script which you want to be run **only** when the script is called directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we instead want to import the `quadratic` function to use elsewhere, we can do so from another file with:\n",
    "\n",
    "`from quadratic import quadratic_errors`\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we have the `__name__ == '__main__'`, our plotting code doesn't get run when we import `quadratic` from this file. This means we can use this file as a **module**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python modules\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python module is a collection of **functions** or **classes** that we intend to use from other programs or notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is simple to do if your notebook or other code file is in the same directory as your module. Like above, simply use the `import` command which we have seen constantly throughout this course. Any of the following will work on our `quadratic.py` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Import the module\n",
    "import quadratic\n",
    "quadratic.quadratic_errors(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Import the module as an alias\n",
    "import quadratic as quad\n",
    "quad.quadratic_errors(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Import the function directly\n",
    "from quadratic import quadratic_errors\n",
    "quadratic_errors(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules are very useful because we can use them to group and keep track of code that we want to re-use or use from a variety of projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have several projects that all need the `quadratic_errors` function, we **don't** want to copy and past the function definition into every file (see [3.1 Python Style](https://cjtu.github.io/spirl/python_style.html)). Instead, we can put our `quadratic_errors` into the `quadratic.py` file we described above and simple import it from the different projects with one of the import statements above. This makes it so that if we ever need to update `quadratic_errors`, we only need to do it in **one place** and can immediate use the changes from all of our projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, `import` statements will only work on local code that is in the same directory, or code that is installed, e.g. with `pip` or `conda`. This is because Python actually has a list of directories it checks whenever you try to `import` from another place. This list of directories is called the **PYTHONPATH** and there is a different **PYTHONPATH** for each of your `conda` environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a module to our **PYTHONPATH** to allow us to import it from anywhere on our computer, we first need to put that module into a **package**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Python recognizes packages with a special file outside of the modules called `__init__.py`. For example, if you want to have the modules `linear`, `quadratic`, and `cubic`, you would set up your directory like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "| my_modules\n",
    "|---- __init__.py\n",
    "|---- cubic.py\n",
    "|---- linear.py\n",
    "|---- quadratic.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `__init__.py` can be completely blank! It just acts as a signifier to Python that there are modules in this folder. The outer folder, `my_modules` is then recognized as the **package**, and can be referred to in an `import` statement like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Import the module\n",
    "from my_modules import quadratic\n",
    "quadratic.quadratic_errors(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Import the module as an alias\n",
    "from my_modules import quadratic as quad\n",
    "quad.quadratic_errors(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Import the function directly\n",
    "from my_modules.quadratic import quadratic_errors\n",
    "quadratic_errors(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing we need to make a local Python package installable (have it added to our path to use it from anywhere) is to add a `setup.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic `setup.py` contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n",
    "\n",
    "setup(\n",
    "    name='MyPackageName',\n",
    "    version='1.0.0',\n",
    "    author='Author Name',\n",
    "    author_email='author@gmail.com',\n",
    "    description='Description of my package',\n",
    "    packages=find_packages(),    \n",
    "    install_requires=[\n",
    "        'numpy >= 1.11.1', \n",
    "        'matplotlib >= 1.5.1',\n",
    "        'other_package >= v.x.y,\n",
    "    ],\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `setup.py` file contains the metadata needed for Python packages. Although there are several newer ways to setup Python packages (e.g., `setup.cfg`, `pyproject.toml`), packaging is a deep topic and we can stick to `setup.py` for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have everything you need to install your local source code!"

    "## Installing from source\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main way to install from source are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normal package install\n",
    "- Install packing in **developer** mode\n",
    "\n",
    "To install a local package normally (e.g., how `pip` and `conda` install packages from the internet), you can run any of the following from the root package directory (the folder with `setup.py`) in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python setup.py install\n",
    "pip install .\n",
    "python -m pip install .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will install the version of the source code *as it was when you ran the command*. The three commands are mostly interchangeable (make sure to refer to the official documentation to see if one of the 3 is recommended over the others).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you edit your package (change any code or functions in the modules), you will **NOT** be able to use these changes with a normally installed package without re-installing or using `pip install` again to install the *updated* package.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install a package in **developer** or **editable** mode, you can run any of the following from the package directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python setup.py develop\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "python -m pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, if you add new functions or edit existing ones in your modules, you will be able to use those changes without running `pip install` again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule of thumb:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are installing a package from the internet that you want to use **as is** and will not be editing any of the source code, use the \"normal\" install (e.g. `python setup.py install`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are installing a local package that you want to use elsewhere, or installing another person's package to tinker with / contribute to the source code, use the `develop` / `-e` mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final note: These instructions are for installing local packages. If you find a Python package on GitHub you'd like to use, you will likely first need to **fork** and then **clone** the repository and then run one of the install commands above."
