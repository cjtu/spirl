    "# Python Modules and Packages\n",
    "A Python **package** is a collection of software written in Python. Many Python packages are *open-source*, meaning they are developed and released for free online. \n",
    "\n",
    "A package can have one of more **modules** in it. A module is a single Python file, often with functions that you can import and use in your own code as long as you have the package installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A package that you will encounter often when doing scientific coding with Python is **matplotlib**. This is a plotting *package* that offers a few *modules* for producing publication-grade figures. One of the modules in matplotlib is **pyplot**, and this is the main plotting module we will use in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing modules\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a module's functions accessible in a script, we need to `import` it. By convention, we write all import statements at the top of our Python programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a package has multiple modules, we can specify a single module to import with `import packagename.modulename`. Functions from an imported module can be invoked with a dot `.` after the name of the module they are found in."
