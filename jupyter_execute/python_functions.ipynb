    "\n",
    "Below the `def` statement is the **docstring** in triple quotes `\"\"\" \"\"\"`. Docstrings are important for humans (including you) who need to read / use your code. The docstring explains what the function does, what arguments the function needs to work properly, and can even suggest example usage. The docsting is what is shown when you call `help(funcname)` on your function.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw with the if blocks, Python uses indentation to organize code. All code indented in the function definition will be run when the function is called. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if your function produces an output, it must be **returned** with a `return` statement. This signals the end of the function. Python will pick up where it left off before running the function.\n",
    "\n",

    "That was an example of writing a function with poor *style*. The function worked as intended, but was frustrating to use if you didn't remember what `stuff()` did. I hope this highlights the importance of readable code. Python comes built-in with features like the **docstring** to avoid situations like the one above. Python won't force you to use docstrings, but it is highly encouraged to get into the habit, especially if you are working with others. And if not for others, do it for future you who won't remember what `stuff()` is in 6 months.\n",
