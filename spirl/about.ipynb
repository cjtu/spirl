    "# Scientific Programming IRL\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Scientific Programming In Real Life** textbook! \n",
    "\n",
    "This book explains practical programming concepts for scientists in a hurry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started with SPIRL\n",
    "\n",
    "This textbook can be used in a few ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- as a top-to-bottom interactive crash course in scientific programming ([start here](bash_about))\n",
    "- as a reference for when you can't remember how to do that one thing (trying searching in the left pane)\n",
    "- to make your own programming course (let me try to convince you to [contribute](https://github.com/cjtu/spirl/CONTRIBUTING.md) to this one instead!)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why another learn-to-code resource?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many free learn-to-code resources which are great but require 40+ hours to complete. On the other hand, quickly copy and pasting impenetrable code from StackOverflow can lead to confusion and the feeling that coding is some sort of arcane art.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book was crafted **by scientists, for scientists** with 2 main philosophies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _scientists are_ **busy**\n",
    "- _scientists like to_ **understand** _how things work_\n",
    "\n",
    "These two philosophies help make this book as **concise** as it can be while giving just **enough depth** to understand why these concepts here are important and how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also meant to be a resource that is easy to follow start-to-finish, but also quick to refer back to in a pinch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An interactive textbook\n",
    "\n",
    "SPIRL is powered by [JupyterBook](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book), a fantastic project which makes responsive online textbooks like this one, while allowing readers to execute code without leaving the site!\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't believe me? Try cliking the rocket icon at the top and choosing the **Live Code** option. This is still an experimental feature so sometimes the kernel is slow to start... But now you should be able to run the cell below!\n"

If you can spare the time, you can support this project by contributing (see above). If you *use any of the code or concepts in an article / lesson / publication* (please feel free to!), you can **cite SPIRL** [here](). If you'd like to support SPIRL by buying me a coffee, you can also do that [here](https://buymeacoff.ee/cjtu).\n"
