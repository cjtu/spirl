# Git basics

Now let's learn to start version controlling some files Git!

## Checking if Git is installed

First thing's first, you will need access to a bash shell or mac Terminal (see [Chapter 1](bash_about)) and to check if Git is installed. Open a shell and type `git --version`.

```bash
git --version
#git version 2.17.1
```

If there is a version number, great! Skip to [Configuring your Git](#configuring-your-git).

If there is no version number, you will need to install Git (this requires administrator access).

In bash, you can run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

For other Linux distributions, find guidance [here](https://git-scm.com/download/linux).

For Mac, the `git --version` command should have prompted you to install it.

For Windows, you should can get access to a bash shell in any of the ways listed [here](bash_shell). In that shell, you can use all of the bash commands to install Git and complete the rest of this chapter.

## Configuring Git

The first thing to do when using git on a new machine is to let Git know who you are so that you get credit for your commits. To do this, we'll use the `git config --global` command (`--global` configures all of your repos, while `--local` configures a single repo only).

*Note*: For your email, use the same one that you used to make your GitHub account (if you have one), or the one you plan to use for GitHub.

```bash
git config --global user.name "<FirstName FamilyName>"
git config --global user.email "<your.email@somewhere.com>"
```

## Git init

In your shell, create a new directory called `myfirstrepo` and change directories to enter it.

```bash
mkdir myfirstrepo
cd myfirstrepo
```

Let's make `myfirstrepo/` a Git repository using `git init`.

*Note*: I will use the comment (`#`) symbol to show you what the output looked like on my computer so that you can follow along. The exact paths and wording may be slightly different on your machine.

```bash
git init
# Initialized empty Git repository in ~/projects/myfirstrepo/.git/
```

You can check that the `.git` folder was created with `ls`.

```bash
ls
# 
```

Oops, since it starts with a `.`, the `.git` folder is hidden, so we need to use the `--all` or `-a` flag for `ls`.

```bash
ls -a
# .  ..  .git
```

Great! That's all there is to it. Git will now track all changes we make to files in `myfirstrepo/`.

## Make some changes

Let's make a new file and see if Git notices. Let's use our the bash redirection trick to make a new file with some text in it.

```bash
echo 'Hello World!' > file1.txt
```

Since Git is tracking `myfirstrepo`, it should have noticed the change.

## Git status

You can always check what Git is seeing with `git status`.

```bash
git status
# On branch master

# No commits yet

# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

#         file1.txt

# nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Git status tells us that we have an *untracked file* in our directory, meaning git won't snapshot this file yet!

## Git add

Before we commit file(s) to history, we must first add them them to the **staging area** with the `add` command.

```bash
git add file1.txt
git status
# On branch master

# No commits yet

# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

#         new file:   file1.txt
```

Now Git status shows a `new file: file1.txt` in the **staging area** (i.e. under "Changes to be committed"). We can keep using `git add` to collect as many files as we want in the staging area before actually making a snapshot.

## Git commit

Once we are happy with all of the *staged* files, we can use `commit` to make a snapshot that will be remembered in our Git history. Let's make our first commit (remember to *write descriptive commit messages!*).

```bash
git commit -m "Add hello world to file1.txt"
# [master (root-commit) 8a7625f] Add hello world to file1.txt
#  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
#  create mode 100644 file1.txt
```

Great! Let's double check that everything got cleared from the staging area with one more `git status`.

```bash
git status
# On branch master
# nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Git log

Where did our commit go? Into **history**, which we can check on at any time with the `git log` command.

```bash
git log

# commit 677ae89418559186a3fa49f726a3ab9bbe97cff3 (HEAD -> master)
# Author: Christian Tai Udovicic <cj.taiudovicic@gmail.com>
# Date:   Sun Jan 1 07:00:00 1984 -0700

    # Add hello world to file1.txt
```

Git log shows us the commit ID, author, date and commit message that we provided. After many commits have been made to a repository, `git log` can help us track down when certain changes were made and by whom.

## TL;DR Tracking files with Git

The *Too Long; Didn't Read* summary:

A file can be in one of "3 locations" according to Git:

1. The **working directory**: the most recent changes to your files in your repo
2. The **staging area**: new or updated files ready to be committed
3. In **history**: all commits (snapshots) since the start of the repo

You can move file(s) from your **working directory** to the **staging area** with `git add`.

You can then move all files in the **staging area** into **history** (i.e. make a snapshot) with `git commit`. This is summarized in the following figure.

![git areas](images/git_at_a_glance.png)

## Practice: multiple files

This time, let's add a couple files to a commit. You can add as many files as you'd like to each commit - all changes in the *staging area* will be included in a commit.

Let's make 3 files, and add two of them to the staging area. We can use the `touch` command to create new empty files.

```bash
touch good_file.doc
touch great_file.py
touch bad_file.xls
ls

# bad_file.xls  file1.txt  good_file.doc  great_file.py
```

Say we want to make a commit with `good_file.doc` and `great_file.py` because we're finished with them, but we're still working on `bad_file.xls` and aren't ready to commit it yet.

Let's add just the first two to the *staging area* with `git add`.

```bash
git add good_file.doc
git add great_file.py
git status

# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
#         new file:   good_file.doc
#         new file:   great_file.py

# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#         bad_file.xls
```

Here, `git status` tells us that two of our files are in the *staging area* and ready to be committed, but `bad_file.xls` is simply in the *working directory* and will not be included in this commit.

Now let's commit these two files. Don't forget the descriptive commit message!

```bash
git commit -m "Add good and great files"
```

Let's check that our new commit is in history with the `git log` command.

```bash
git log
# commit cbc5a6ea58976cb5c0e5f0eb2ec5a2ca5da38f6c (HEAD -> master)
# Author: Christian Tai Udovicic <cj.taiudovicic@gmail.com>
# Date:   Sun Jan 1 07:01:00 1984 -0700

#     Add good and great files

# commit 677ae89418559186a3fa49f726a3ab9bbe97cff3
# Author: Christian Tai Udovicic <cj.taiudovicic@gmail.com>
# Date:   Sun Jan 1 07:00:00 1984 -0700

#     Add hello world to file1.txt
```

Git log can be pretty verbose. Let's make the output cleaner with the `--oneline` flag.

```bash
git log --oneline
# cbc5a6e (HEAD -> master) Add good and great files
# 677ae89 Add hello world to file1.txt
```

Now we see there are 2 commits - one per line, from most recent to oldest. The `HEAD -> master` tells us that we are currently located at the most recent commit on the default branch called `master` (we will explore branches in the next lesson).

## Git reset

Say we committed something by mistake, or want to revert our repo to an older version. To do this we use the `git reset` command!

The `git reset` command needs a *commit ID* to tell it which point in history you want to reset to. In my example above, the commit I want to revert to is **677ae89**, but yours will be a different string of letters and numbers shown by `git log`. You can revert to *any point in history* by specifying the commit ID you'd like to return to.

**Git reset HEAD**

While we can `git reset <commit ID>` on the ID of the previous commit if we just want to undo our last commit, we can use the useful shortcut `git reset HEAD~1`.

The shorthand `HEAD~<number>` gives the current location of `HEAD` minus the `<number>`. In our case `HEAD~1` would be the previous commit (**8a7625f**, in my case). Likewise, `HEAD~2` would be the second-last commit, `HEAD~3` would be third-last, etc.).

**Reset options**

Git has 3 options for resetting commits:

- `--soft` dumps all of the reverted changes into the **staging area** (used for quick updates, maybe you forgot to stage a file and want to add it to this commit)
- no flag will dump changes into the **working directory** (you will need to re-stage all changes you want to commit)
- `--hard` should be used with caution: it completely deletes all changes since the commit you are reverting to! Use this only if you know you want to delete all changes since a particular commit.

## Practice: Git reset

Ok, let's revert our last commit (`HEAD~1`) and put the changes back into the *staging area* with the `--soft` flag.

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git status

# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
#         new file:   good_file.doc
#         new file:   great_file.py

# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#         bad_file.xls
```

Great, now that our changes are back in the staging area, we can confirm that the last commit was removed from history:

```bash
git log --oneline
# 677ae89 (HEAD -> master) Add hello world to file1.txt
```

The second commit was removed and `HEAD` was moved back to our "hello world" commit.

Now, say we decided against committing `good_file.doc` and only want to commit `great_file.py`. We can remove items from the staging area at any point with the normal `git reset` command.

```bash
git reset good_file.doc
git status

# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
#         new file:   great_file.py

# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#         bad_file.xls
#         good_file.doc
```

Now `great_file.py` is staged and ready to be committed! Let's commit it with a new, descriptive commit message.

```bash
git commit -m "Add great file"
git log --oneline

# d0051d1 (HEAD -> master) Add great file
# 677ae89 Add hello world to file1.txt
```

Great! Now we have a brand new commit (with a new ID) which includes just the changes to `great_file.py` that we wanted.

## Git commit --amend

We just learned how to revert the previous commit make a small change and re-commit it.  This can be done in one step with the shortcut `git commit --amend`.

Say we now want to include `bad_file.xls` in our most recent commit. We can add it to the staging area and then use `git commit --amend` to include it in the previous commit. If we want the commit message to remain the same, we can add the `--no-edit` flag.

```bash
git add bad_file.xls
git commit --amend --no-edit
git status

# On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#         good_file.doc

# nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Now `bad_file.xls` has been added to our previous commit. Let's see if anything changed in our Git history:

```bash
git log --oneline

# c250ab6 (HEAD -> master) Add great file
# 677ae89 Add hello world to file1.txt
```

Notice that the commit message remained the same because of the `--no-edit` flag, but the commit ID changed (`d0051d1` became `c250ab6`)! Anytime you amend a commit (or revert and re-commit), Git will make a new unique ID for that commit.

## Summary

You now know how to **version control** your files in Git! This consists of:

- staging files with `git add`
- committing snapshots of your repository with `git commit`
- reverting to old snapshots with `git reset`
- finding old snapshot IDs with `git log`

With these basics, you can start keeping track of **versions** of your code or files locally over time. So far we've learned to use Git on our local computer. In the next lesson, we will learn how to back up our repository.
