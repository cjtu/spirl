    "## If statements\n",
    "\n",
    "If statements allow you to change the execution of your code based on whether or not a condition is met. They consist of a **condition** (the boolean expression) and a **clause** (the stuff to do if the condition is `True`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If statements will often use **comparison operators** like `==` (is equal to) to determine whether the following code is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The if statement follows the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "if 'something' == 'something else':\n",
    "    # this is the clause that is run if the condition is true\n",
    "    # it will run this code\n",
    "    # and everything else indented here\n",
    "# This un-indented code is no longer part of the clause\n",
