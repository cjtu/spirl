    "### Basic Curve Fitting\n",
    "When you know the form your data should take, it is relatively straight forward to fit a curve to the data. The **scipy.optimize.curve_fit** function will find a best fit curve for the data that is input. However, you must already know the general form of the equation to fit to your data and create a function containing this information to use this function. The **curve_fit** finds the best set of coefficients or paramaters based on the function you provide using a least squares minimization - it finds the coefficient values for a curve with the smallest sum of the offsets or residuals of points from the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if you're data is sinusoidal and you in put an exponential function, **curve_fit** will return the exponential curve that fits your data *best* - but it will probably be a terrible fit! You are resonsible for inputting a reasonable function when using this method. **curve_fit** is great when you want a model of your data to understand the basic relationship and be able to predict points efficiently. It is not the best choice when you do not know the general form of your data, or otherwise need to find the best possibe fit of any form.\n",

    "## Scipy is Useful!\n",
    "These are two basic, yet very common uses of scipy - but it's capabilities extend far beyond what we can cover in this tutorial. Whenever you need to do any standard mathematical optimization or data processes, I suggest you first look to see if there is already a function in scipy that can accomplish what you need. When there isn't, it's often something highly specialized or field dependent, and you may find it in a library or module that's tied to your specific area of science or data type. Google is your friend, take advantage of the extensive amounts of documentation and open source code available to you. There's no need to re-invent the wheel if there's already code out there that is designed to do exactly what you need."
